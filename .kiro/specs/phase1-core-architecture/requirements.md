# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines Phase 1 of implementing a scalable architecture for the Labyrinth Leap maze game. The goal is to establish clean separation between game logic and presentation while introducing a data-driven level system that can scale to thousands of levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Game Logic Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want game logic separated from presentation so that I can test, validate, and modify game rules independently of the UI framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the core game logic SHALL be completely independent of Phaser
2. WHEN game state changes THEN the core SHALL emit events that the presentation layer can subscribe to
3. WHEN running tests THEN the core game logic SHALL be testable without any UI dependencies
4. WHEN the player makes a move THEN the core SHALL validate the move and update state deterministically
5. WHEN the game ends THEN the core SHALL calculate final score and completion status independently

### Requirement 2: Deterministic Game Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game engine to be deterministic so that replays, analytics, and anti-cheat systems work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN given the same seed and inputs THEN the game SHALL produce identical results every time
2. WHEN a level is generated THEN it SHALL use a deterministic PRNG based on level ID and seed
3. WHEN player actions are recorded THEN they SHALL be replayable to produce the same outcome
4. WHEN the game state is serialized THEN it SHALL contain all information needed to restore the exact state
5. WHEN random events occur THEN they SHALL be based on the deterministic PRNG, not Math.random()

### Requirement 3: Level Schema Definition

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want levels defined in JSON format so that I can create and modify levels without changing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a level is loaded THEN it SHALL be defined by a JSON schema with all necessary properties
2. WHEN the level schema includes THEN it SHALL contain id, version, seed, board size, objectives, and rewards
3. WHEN a level supports procedural generation THEN it SHALL store seed and generation parameters
4. WHEN a level is handcrafted THEN it SHALL store the complete layout data
5. WHEN the schema version changes THEN old level definitions SHALL remain compatible through migrations

### Requirement 4: Game State Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game progress to be tracked accurately so that I can resume games and see my achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player moves THEN the game state SHALL update to reflect the new position
2. WHEN orbs are collected THEN the collection state SHALL be tracked in the game state
3. WHEN the level is completed THEN the final state SHALL include completion time and score
4. WHEN the game is paused THEN the current state SHALL be serializable for later restoration
5. WHEN the player restarts THEN the game state SHALL reset to the initial level state

### Requirement 5: Event-Driven Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the core to communicate with the presentation layer through events so that the UI can react to game changes without tight coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player moves THEN the core SHALL emit a 'playerMoved' event with position data
2. WHEN an orb is collected THEN the core SHALL emit an 'orbCollected' event with orb details
3. WHEN the level is completed THEN the core SHALL emit a 'levelCompleted' event with results
4. WHEN the game state changes THEN the core SHALL emit appropriate events for UI updates
5. WHEN the presentation layer subscribes THEN it SHALL receive all relevant game events

### Requirement 6: Level Loading System

**User Story:** As a player, I want levels to load quickly and reliably so that I can start playing without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a level is requested THEN the system SHALL load the level definition from the appropriate source
2. WHEN loading a procedural level THEN the system SHALL generate the level from seed and parameters
3. WHEN loading a handcrafted level THEN the system SHALL parse the stored layout data
4. WHEN a level fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback or error handling
5. WHEN multiple levels are needed THEN the system SHALL support batch loading for performance

### Requirement 7: Core API Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean API for the game core so that I can easily integrate it with different presentation layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the core THEN it SHALL provide methods for startLevel, makeMove, and getState
2. WHEN the core is queried THEN it SHALL provide read-only access to current game state
3. WHEN actions are performed THEN the core SHALL validate inputs and reject invalid operations
4. WHEN the core state changes THEN it SHALL maintain immutability principles for predictable behavior
5. WHEN the core is used THEN it SHALL provide TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### Requirement 8: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for the core logic so that I can ensure game reliability and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN core functions are tested THEN they SHALL have unit tests covering all major paths
2. WHEN deterministic behavior is tested THEN golden tests SHALL verify consistent outputs
3. WHEN level generation is tested THEN it SHALL verify solvability and constraint compliance
4. WHEN game rules are tested THEN edge cases and boundary conditions SHALL be covered
5. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL execute quickly without external dependencies
