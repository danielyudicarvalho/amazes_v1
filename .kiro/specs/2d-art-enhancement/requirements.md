# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the current maze game from basic geometric shapes to a visually appealing 2D art experience. The enhancement will include custom sprites, animations, particle effects, and themed visual elements while maintaining the game's core functionality and performance. The art style will be cohesive, engaging, and suitable for both mobile and web platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see beautiful 2D artwork instead of basic shapes, so that the game feels more polished and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display custom 2D sprites for all game elements instead of geometric shapes
2. WHEN the player moves THEN the system SHALL show smooth sprite-based animations for character movement
3. WHEN orbs are collected THEN the system SHALL display animated collection effects with particles
4. WHEN the maze is rendered THEN the system SHALL use textured tiles and themed wall sprites
5. IF the game runs on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance with all visual enhancements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want consistent visual theming throughout the game, so that it feels like a cohesive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any game screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL use a consistent color palette and art style
2. WHEN UI elements are shown THEN the system SHALL use themed buttons, backgrounds, and interface elements
3. WHEN different levels are played THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency while allowing for level-specific variations
4. WHEN the game transitions between states THEN the system SHALL use smooth, themed transition effects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want animated visual feedback for my actions, so that the game feels responsive and alive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player character moves THEN the system SHALL play directional movement animations
2. WHEN the player attempts an invalid move THEN the system SHALL show a bounce or shake animation
3. WHEN orbs are collected THEN the system SHALL play collection animations with sound-synchronized effects
4. WHEN the level is completed THEN the system SHALL display celebratory particle effects and animations
5. WHEN buttons are pressed THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback with hover and press states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to load quickly despite enhanced graphics, so that I can start playing immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL load all essential art assets within 3 seconds
2. WHEN switching between levels THEN the system SHALL preload level-specific assets without blocking gameplay
3. WHEN assets are loading THEN the system SHALL display an attractive loading screen with progress indication
4. IF assets fail to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to basic shapes with error logging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a flexible art asset system, so that I can easily update and maintain visual elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new art assets are added THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and load them without code changes
2. WHEN asset configurations change THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading during development
3. WHEN different screen sizes are used THEN the system SHALL scale assets appropriately while maintaining quality
4. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage texture memory and dispose unused assets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want environmental details and atmosphere, so that each level feels unique and immersive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a level loads THEN the system SHALL display appropriate background elements and atmospheric details
2. WHEN the player explores THEN the system SHALL show subtle environmental animations (floating particles, ambient movement)
3. WHEN different level themes are encountered THEN the system SHALL adapt visual elements to match the theme
4. WHEN lighting effects are appropriate THEN the system SHALL apply subtle lighting and shadow effects to enhance depth
