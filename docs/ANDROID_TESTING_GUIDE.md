### 3. Run the App

1. **In Android Studio:**
   - Make sure your project is open
   - Select your AVD from the device dropdown
   - Click the green ‚ñ∂Ô∏è (Run) button
   - Or press `Shift + F10`

2. **Build Process:**
   - Gradle will build the project
   - APK will be installed on emulator
   - App will launch automatically

### 5. Performance Testing

#### Frame Rate Testing
1. **Enable Developer Options on Emulator:**
   - Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `About emulated device`
   - Tap `Build number` 7 times
   - Go back to `Settings` ‚Üí `Developer options`
   - Enable `Profile GPU rendering`
   - Select `On screen as bars`

2. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Green bars should stay below the horizontal line (16ms)
   - Consistent frame times indicate smooth performance

#### Memory Testing
1. **In Android Studio:**
   - Open `View` ‚Üí `Tool Windows` ‚Üí `Profiler`
   - Select your app process
   - Monitor memory usage during gameplay
   - Look for memory leaks (constantly increasing memory)

### 6. Debug Common Issues

#### App Won't Launch
```bash
# Check if emulator is detected
adb devices

# Clear app data
adb shell pm clear com.example.maze

# Reinstall app
./gradlew installDebug
```

#### Performance Issues
- Reduce maze size in level definitions
- Check for memory leaks in browser DevTools
- Optimize image assets
- Enable hardware acceleration in emulator

#### Touch Controls Not Working
- Verify touch events are properly handled
- Check CSS touch-action properties
- Test with different emulator configurations

#### WebView Issues
- Enable WebView debugging in app
- Use Chrome DevTools to inspect WebView
- Check for CORS issues with local assets

### 7. Testing on Different Devices

#### Test Matrix
| Device Type | Screen Size | API Level | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Phone Small | 5.0" | API 21+ | Minimum supported |
| Phone Medium | 6.0" | API 28+ | Most common |
| Phone Large | 6.7" | API 30+ | Modern devices |
| Tablet | 10.1" | API 28+ | Landscape testing |

#### Emulator Configurations
```bash
# Create different AVDs for testing
# Small phone
avdmanager create avd -n "Small_Phone" -k "system-images;android-28;google_apis;x86_64" -d "pixel"

# Large phone  
avdmanager create avd -n "Large_Phone" -k "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86_64" -d "pixel_4_xl"

# Tablet
avdmanager create avd -n "Tablet" -k "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86_64" -d "pixel_c"
```

### 8. Automated Testing

#### Create Test Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# automated-android-test.sh

echo "Starting automated Android testing..."

# Build and sync
npm run build
npx cap sync android

# Start emulator
emulator -avd Labyrinth_Leap_Test -no-snapshot-load &
sleep 60  # Wait for emulator to boot

# Install and run app
cd android
./gradlew installDebug
adb shell am start -n com.example.maze/.MainActivity

echo "App launched. Perform manual testing now."
```

### 9. Release Testing

#### Before Release

#### Release Build
```bash
# Build release APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Test release build
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### 10. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: App crashes on startup**

# Check logs
adb logcat | grep -i "maze"
```

**Issue: White screen after launch**
- Check network connectivity
- Verify all assets are bundled
- Check for JavaScript errors

**Issue: Touch not working**
- Verify emulator supports touch
- Check CSS touch-action properties
